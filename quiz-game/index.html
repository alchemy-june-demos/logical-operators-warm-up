            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Each team member must answer one question</li>
                <li>If you get the answer right on your own, you get 2 points for your team.</li>
                <li>
                    You may "phone a friend" (i.e. ask your teammates) and get 1 point for your
                    team.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you get it wrong, the opposite team can "steal" for 1 point but if you get it
                    wrong on the steal you lose a point.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You must decide before the question is revealed which team member is going to be
                    answering the question.
